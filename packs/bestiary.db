Their small bodies have a surprising amount of strength with a deceptively thick hide to protect them. Their sharp beaks bite with enough force to cleave through bone with ease and are most often utilized in amputating small extremities, like fingers and toes, to make it more difficult for humanoids to fight back.

As mouth closes, the circular bottom jaw rotates inwards which uses the teeth to pull prey more firmly into its grasp while slashing and shredding. This motion is particularly effective against the flesh of the cephalopods that make up its preferred prey. Despite its fearsome appearance and resemblance to a shark, the helicoprion actually belongs to the same group of cartilaginous fish as ratfish and chimeras. Larger members of the helicoprion can commonly reach 25 feet, but they have been known to grow beyond that to a maximum of 35 feet.</p>\n<p><em><sup>Art source: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wscottheath/350759885/in/photolist-8dec7K-mAm9xn-eWZNbi-5gAH1o-p5JDB8-pkbDfu-TY8zPs-Uatzv4-29RfZvU-Uioa9W-U84iBS-UbXaCh-T1Wtrk-U3WXXr-wZJGe-T1WCgp-U3X7Ga-pndAHt-Uapdkg-T8pN7g-p5Jyfg-T1WDRZ-p5Hmo4-UmYkC4-U7YU3A-U3XcvZ-UmYfu8-Uio653-4n4bd5-SYqeBD-wZJGb-Uio3Pw-SVB4Ay-UcYJza\">Flickr </a>and modified under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC BY 2.0</a></sup></em></p>\n<p><sub><em>Compendium entry by Parker (sparkcities#2000), in</em><em>formation from <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2013/02/26/buzzsaw-jaw-helicoprion-was-a-freaky-ratfish/\">National Geographic</a></em><em>&nbsp;</em></sub></p>","public":""},"alignment":"","race":"","type":"","environment":"","cr":4,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1100},"source":""},"traits":{"size":"grg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"blindsight 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":7,"prof":0,"total":7,"passive":17},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"prof":0,"total":-4,"passive":6},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/SupplementalBestiary/assets/helicoprion.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Helicoprion","displayName":0,"img":"modules/SupplementalBestiary/assets/helicoprion.png","tint":null,"width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"Mn7hIQSTl2FRfPaF","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"oOUvgP1AZF0O1hE7","flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"srd","system":"dnd5e","coreVersion":"0.7.1","systemVersion":0.94}},"name":"Bite","type":"weapon","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/red_29.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><strong>Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

Their small bodies are covered with tightly packed scales that serve as natural armor and thick, plated tails for balance as they run at high speeds. One Pseudoraptor on its own is hardly a threat to most other creatures, but a dozen Pseudoraptors tracking a wayward humanoid is another story entirely. They find the most hunting success in surrounding their prey, throwing themselves at it to knock it off its feet, and piling on while its prone on the ground. Their large eyes are well-equipped to detecting the smallest of movements in the dark but also make them vulnerable to bright light. When confronted with something that emits bright light, their strongest individuals will attack the light source ferociously in an attempt to make it go away.</p>\n<p><sub><em>Art source: <a

They soar like spirits through snowstorms and are keenly aware of their surroundings to find their prey. Among owl species, snowy owls are one of the largest and are alone in the overall white coloration of their plumage. The males and females differ slightly in coloration with the males being more purely white and females are more often speckled with darker brown flecks. Unlike many owls, they are routinely active during the daylight hours with this being particularly true in the summer. They are immensely adaptable to hunting any available small prey such as water birds or smaller mammals, but will also feed on carrion when the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n<p><sub><em>Art

The other head emits a thick, opaque fog that quickly encases an large area and causes disorientation. Teakettlers are often used in packs as guards to keep unwanted visitors out of a certain area. Teakettlers heavily rely on their whistle and the power of their fog because they are not built for confrontation otherwise.

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>\n<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall.

Depending on the variety, they feed on raw or refined gold, silver, or bronze. They emit a soft light from their bodies based on the content of their diet. Bronze Alicanto feed on bronze and so they emit a soft bronze light from their bodies. Miners often try to stalk them in the hopes of striking it rich, but Alicanto despise this behavior. If they catch someone trying to follow them to a potential food source, they will lure them to a cliffside and attempt to push them off.</p>\n<p>When faced with conflict, they prefer to take flight and attack with molten hot metallic spit. Bronze Alicanto spit molten silver on their enemies, often aiming for the eyes and face in an attempt to stun. Alicanto of different varieties do not like others outside of their variety and will often engage in territorial conflicts if different metals are found in the same location. Genetics determines which individual will become the leader of its flock.
